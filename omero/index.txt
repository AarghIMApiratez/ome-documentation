#############################

The OMERO |release| documentation is divided into three parts.
:doc:`users/index` introduces the user-facing client applications and how to
get started, as well as detailing where users can access further help and
support. System administrators wanting to install an OMERO server can find
instructions in the :doc:`sysadmins/index`. Finally, developers can find more
specific and technical information about OMERO in the :doc:`developers/index`.
