In navigating the model objects used by the :doc:`OMERO API
<../Modules/Api>` and in :omerocmd:`hql` it is often useful to look up
the names of the object properties and the types of their values. This
reference document lists every OMERO model object and their more useful
properties, with an emphasis on enumerating every direct relationship
among the objects.
