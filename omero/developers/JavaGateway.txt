Java Gateway documentation
---------------------------
The Java :javadoc:`Gateway <omero/gateway/Gateway.html>` is a
wrapper around the :zerocdoc:`Ice Java language mapping
<display/Ice/Hello+World+Application>` and the :doc:`Modules/Api` which makes
it easier to interact with an OMERO server in Java.

The :javadoc:`Gateway <omero/gateway/Gateway.html>` is the central object
for maintaining the connection to the server. 
See :ref:`gatewayconnect`

Functionality for interacting with the server is encapsulated into different
Facilities: http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.2.5/api/omero/gateway/facility/package-summary.html (TODO: Replace with proper javadoc link. How link to package-summary page?)
For example using the :javadoc:`BrowseFacility <omero/gateway/facility/BrowseFacility.html>`
to access Projects, Datasets, etc.: :ref:`gatewaybrowse`

As the plain Ice objects can be a bit 'bulky' to handle, they are usually wrapped
into Java  :javadoc:`DataObjects <omero/gateway/model/DataObject.html>`.
