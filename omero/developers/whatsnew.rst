What's new for OMERO 5.6 for developers
=======================================

This release focuses on migrating all Python components to Python 3,
and decoupling them into separate repositories with the benefit of
permitting each to be released to PyPI independently:

- https://github.com/ome/omero-py
- https://github.com/ome/omero-web
- https://github.com/ome/omero-dropbox
- https://github.com/ome/omero-marshal

For details on migrating your own code to Python 3, see
:doc:`python3-migration`.
