Installing OMERO from source
============================

Installing Git
--------------

In general, see the Git `downloads page <http://git-scm.com/download>`_ for
installation options.

Linux
^^^^^

Most flavors of Linux have git available through the package manager. For
example, on Debian or Ubuntu::

  sudo apt-get install git

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

You can install git using `Homebrew <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/>`_::

  brew install git

Or you can use the `binary installer <http://git-scm.com/download>`_.

Windows
^^^^^^^

We recommend using either msysGit_ for a basic git installation, or Cygwin_
for a full-featured Unix-style environment that includes git. You can also use
TortoiseGit_ for git shell integration. You may also want to consider
installing VirtualBox_ with a Linux guest OS to make your life easier. Lastly,
when using git on Windows, please be aware of the `CRLF conversion issue`_.

Cloning the source code
-----------------------

The main repository for OMERO, known as ome.git, is available from:

-  https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy
-  git://openmicroscopy.org/ome.git

Most OME development is currently happening on GitHub, therefore it is highly
suggested that you become familiar with how it works, if not create an account
for yourself.

Start by cloning the official repository::

  git clone https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy.git

Since the openmicroscopy repository now makes use of submodules, you first
need to initialize all the submodules::

  cd openmicroscopy
  git submodule update --init

Alternatively, with version 1.6.5 of git and later, you can pass the
:option:`--recursive` option to git clone and initialize all submodules::

  git clone --recursive https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy.git

.. seealso::
  :devs_doc:`Using Git <using-git.html>`
    Section of the contributing documentation explaining how to use Git for
    contributing to the source code.

Installing OMERO
----------------

To install the dependencies required to run the OMERO.server on Linux
or Mac OS X, take a look at the
:doc:`/sysadmins/unix/server-installation` or the
:doc:`/sysadmins/unix/server-install-homebrew` sections.

Additional dependencies are necessary for building the server and clients:

- `Genshi <http://genshi.edgewall.org/>`_ can be installed using either the
  package manager or Python packaging tools such as ``easy_install`` or
  ``pip``::

    pip install Genshi

Finally, some environment variables need to be properly setup before building
the server:

- :envvar:`SLICE_PATH` must point at the :file:`slice` directory of the Ice
  installation.

Once all the dependencies and environment variables are set up, you can build
the server using::

    python build.py

or the clients using::

    python build.py release-clients
