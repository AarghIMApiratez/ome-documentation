What's new for OMERO 5
======================

- :doc:`logging` and :doc:`Server/Properties` have been updated to explain the
  new logging configuration in OMERO.fs.

- :doc:`Modules/Delete` has been updated to explain how OMERO 5 handles
  deleting multi-file images and image sets and to clarify the finality of
  deletion.

- :doc:`Server/FS` has been updated to give an overview of the OMERO.fs
  project, and further details of the
  :doc:`ManagedRepository/ManagedRepository` are being added.

- :doc:`OMERO.web <Web>` has been upgraded to Django 1.6, requiring Python
  2.6.5 or later. This enables more flexibility for developing new web
  apps and plugins. All the :doc:`OMERO.web documentation <index>` has been
  updated to reflect these changes.

- :doc:`scripts/index` and :doc:`scripts/matlab-scripts` have been updated to 
  reflect that MATLAB and Jython scripts are now supported natively.

- Guidance for getting more involved with OME, and contributing to both OMERO
  and Bio-Formats, has been moved to our new
  :devs_doc:`Contributing Developer Documentation <>` section so it is easier
  to find. It has also been updated to better explain our development
  processes.

- :doc:`Python` describes additions to the BlitzGateway API to support Filesets.
