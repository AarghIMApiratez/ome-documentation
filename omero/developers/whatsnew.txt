What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

- :doc:`Server/ObjectGraphs` explains how the new graph operations of
  :javadoc:`omero::cmd <slice2html/omero/cmd.html>` are implemented.
- Deprecated methods in IContainer and RenderingEngine have been removed, as
  have the deprecated services IDelete and Gateway.
- Pojos methods have been deprecated and replaced by corresponding units
  methods.
- OMERO 5.1 requires a Unicode-encoded (UTF8) database.
- Transient-ness is now part of the public API.


Breaking changes
----------------

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

There have been many updates to this client for 5.1. See the
:ref:`web-breaking-changes` section on the :doc:`/sysadmins/whatsnew` for
sysadmins page for further details. Additional developer-specific changes 

Graphs
^^^^^^

The API's request operations :javadoc:`Chgrp
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify.html>`, are now
deprecated. They are replaced by :javadoc:`Chgrp2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp2.html>`, :javadoc:`Chown2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown2.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete2
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete2.html>`, and their superclass
:javadoc:`GraphModify2 <slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify2.html>`. To
allow each deprecated request to be implemented by its corresponding
replacement, a partial API compatibility layer is included in OMERO 5.1
and is activated by default through the new configuration property
:property:`omero.graphs.wrap`. If the new request implementations
introduce regressions, setting that property to ``false`` will
reactivate the implementations from OMERO 5.0. However, the
configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` will be *removed*
in OMERO 5.2 and :javadoc:`Chgrp <slice2html/omero/cmd/Chgrp.html>`,
:javadoc:`Chown <slice2html/omero/cmd/Chown.html>`, :javadoc:`Delete
<slice2html/omero/cmd/Delete.html>`, and :javadoc:`GraphModify
<slice2html/omero/cmd/GraphModify.html>`, will be *removed* in OMERO
5.3. OMERO 5.1 users should thus be :doc:`using the new 5.1 graph
requests <Server/GraphsMigration>` so that problems may be detected and
corrected before the deprecated features are removed.

Tables
^^^^^^

OMERO.tables attribute names beginning with `__` are reserved for internal
use, see :doc:`Tables`.

ImportContainer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changes to ImportContainer will break any listeners implemented by external
developers.
