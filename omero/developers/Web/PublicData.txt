Public data in OMERO.web
========================

Public user
-----------

Since OMERO 4.4, the OMERO.web framework has supported auto-login for a single
username / password. This means that any "public" visitors to certain
OMERO.web pages will be automatically logged in and will be able to access the
data available to the defined 'public user'.

Here is how to go about setting this up on your OMERO.web install:

-   Create a group with read-only permissions (name can be anything e.g.
    "public-data"). We use read-only permissions so that the public user will
    not be able to modify, delete or annotate data belonging to other members.

-   Create a member of this group, noting the username and password (we will
    enter these below). Again, the First Name, Last Name, username and
    password can be anything you like.

-   Enable the :property:`omero.web.public.enabled` and set their
    :property:`omero.web.public.user` and
    :property:`omero.web.public.password`:

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.enabled True

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.user '<username>'

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.password '<password>'

-   Set a :property:`omero.web.public.url_filter` for which the OMERO.web
    public user is allowed to navigate.
    Default: '^/(?!webadmin)' (Python reqular expression).

    The idea is that you can create the public pages yourself since we do not
    provide them. For example, to allow only
    URLs that start with '/my_web_public' you would use:

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '/my_web_public'

    If you simply want to enable the image viewer you can use:

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '/webgateway'
    
    Then you can access public images via the following link
    `\http://your_host/webgateway/img_detail/IMAGE_ID/`. Please remember that
    public images must be in a public group where public user can access them.


    You can use the full webclient UI for public browsing of images. However,
    the webclient UI was not designed for public use and allows various actions
    that create data or are resource intensive.
    These can be selectively disabled via the url filter using the following command:

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.url_filter '^/(?!webadmin|webclient/(action|logout|annotate_(file|tags|comment|rating|map)|script_ui|ome_tiff|figure_script)|webgateway/(archived_files|download_as))'


    Exotic matching techniques can be used but more explicit regular
    expressions are needed when attempting to filter based on a base URL:

    ::

        'webtest' matches '/webtest' but also '/webclient/webtest'
        'dataset' matches  '/webtest/dataset' and also '/webclient/dataset'
        '/webtest' matches '/webtest…' but also '/webclient/webtest'
        '/webtest' matches '/webtest…' but not '/webclient/webtest'

-   Set a :property:`omero.web.public.server_id` public user will be automatically
    connected to. Default: 1 (the first server in :property:`omero.web.server_list`)

    ::

        $ bin/omero config set omero.web.public.server_id 1

    If you wish to mix public and restricted access to the system, the user
    can always access the login page using the following link
    `\http://your_host/webclient/login/`.


Reusing OMERO session
---------------------

Since OMERO 4.4, the OMERO.web framework has supported password-less, OMERO
session key-based authentication. For example a direct link to image will look
as follows:

::

    https://your_host/webgateway/img_detail/IMAGE_ID/?server=SERVER_ID&bsession=OMERO_SESSION_KEY

.. note::

    SERVER_ID should match the index from the list set using
    :property:`omero.web.server_list` from the server session
    you created. If your list contains only one server the index will be 1.

For more details about how to create an OMERO session see
:doc:`server-side session </developers/Server/Sessions>` or
use :doc:`command line interface </users/cli/sessions>` to create one.
