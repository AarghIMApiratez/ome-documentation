OMERO Command Line Interface
============================

        System Administrator documentation for the Command Line Interface

Help for any specific CLI command can be displayed using the :option:`-h`
argument. See :ref:`cli_help` for more information.

Extensions
----------

Plugins can be written and put in the ``lib/python/omero/plugins``
directory. On execution, all plugins in that directory are registered
with the |CLI|. Alternatively, the "--path" argument can be used to point to
other plugin files or directories.

Thread-safety
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``omero.cli.CLI`` should be considered thread-*un*\ safe. A single
connection object is accessible from all plugins via
``self.ctx.conn(args)``, and it is assumed that changes to this object
will only take place in the current thread. The |CLI| instance itself,
however, can be passed between multiple threads, as long as only one
accesses it sequentially, possibly via locking.

General notes
-------------

-  :file:`bin/omero` will find its installation. Therefore, to install OMERO
   it is only necessary to unpack the bundle, and put :file:`bin/omero`
   somewhere on your path.
-  Any command can be produced by symlinking :file:`bin/omero` to a file of
   the form "omero-command-arg1-arg2". This is useful under :file:`/etc/rc.d`
   to have a startup script.
-  All commands respond to :omerocmd:`help`.
