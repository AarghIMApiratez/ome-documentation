OMERO.fs
========

The OMERO.fs service runs somewhere within
|OmeroGrid| and is responsible for watching a
particular filesystem directory for changes. These change events are
then signalled to any observers, who can optionally begin reading the
file once updated. OMERO.fs currently consists of two components:

OMERO.fs DropBox is designed for watching a
directory and kicking off an automatic import. The configuration of the
DropBox system is covered on the :doc:`/sysadmins/server-fs` system 
administrator's page.

OMERO.fs-lite is designed to allow
system administrators to point OMERO at an existing directory without
requiring the data duplication required by a traditional import. The changes 
to the import system mean that an OMERO.fs server stores the original files in 
the ``ManagedRepository``, preserving file names and any nested directory 
structure. This improves the way OMERO deals with HCS data, allowing multiple files
