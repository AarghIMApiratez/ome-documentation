Working with OMERO virtual appliance
------------------------------------

Now that your |VM| is up and running you have a choice about how to
interact with it.

-  You can connect to OMERO.web from your host browser. Go to
   http://localhost:8080/webclient.
-  You can **use OMERO.clients from within your host OS.** This will
   allow you to import data via a GUI and manage that data once
   imported. To do so, download the :downloads:`OMERO.insight client <>`
   and follow the instructions below. More information can be found on our
   :help:`help website <>` which provides workflow-based guides to using the
   OMERO.clients.
-  Alternatively, you can interact with the server command line
   interface by |SSH|'ing into the guest |VM| or by opening a console within
   the |VM| itself. Administrators may need to use one of these methods to
   restart the server and/or change configuration parameters. In this
   case, you must have an |SSH| client installed on your host machine to use
   to connect to the OMERO.server.

.. note:: 
    The following examples assume that the OMERO |VM| is up and running on the
    same machine that you are working on.

OMERO.web
^^^^^^^^^

Go directly to http://localhost:8080/webclient to log in with user:
"root" / pw: "omero".

.. note::
    If you receive a 502 nginx error on first attempting to
    connect to the web app on http://localhost:8080/webclient/ please
    restart the virtual machine and try again.

OMERO.insight
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can run regular OMERO clients on your host machine and connect to
the server in the |VM|. Our example uses OMERO.insight running on Mac OS X
to connect to the |VM|.

-  :downloads:`Download <>` and install OMERO.insight
-  Start OMERO.insight
-  Click the spanner icon situated above the password box to
   enter the server settings box shown below.

   Setting OMERO.insight server address and port number

-  Use the *+* icon to add a new server entry with the address
   *localhost* and the port *4064* then click apply
-  You can now use the login credentials given above to log into OMERO.insight
   using the login window shown below (user: "root" / pw: "omero").

   :align: center
   :figwidth: 45%

   :alt: OMERO.insight login window

   OMERO.insight login window

-  OMERO.insight should now load up and display the main window.

You can now use OMERO.insight to import and manage images on a locally running
virtual server just like you would use the standard remote server.

.. note:: A Getting Started guide is available for OMERO.insight on our
    :help:`help website <getting-started-5.html>` if you need further
    assistance to download and install the software.

Secure Shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can log into your |VM| using |SSH|, allowing you to use the
:doc:`command-line-interface`.
In the following example, we assume that you have an |SSH| client installed
on your host machine and also that your |VM| is up and running.

You can log into the |VM| using the above credentials and the following
command typed into a terminal:

::

    $ ssh omero@localhost -p 2222

This invokes the |SSH| program telling it to login to the localhost on
port 2222 using the username *omero*. Remember that earlier you set up
port forwarding to forward port 2222 on the host machine to port 22 (the
default |SSH| port) on the guest |VM|. You should be prompted
for a password. Once you have successfully entered your password, you
should be greeted by a prompt similar to the following:

::

    omero@omerovm:~$

There are two potential complications to this method, (1) if you have
used a |VM| before then there could be old |SSH| fingerprints set up, (2)
the first time that you log into the |VM| you will be asked to confirm
that you wish to continue connecting. If you get the following message after
you invoke SSH, you need to remove the old fingerprints:

::

    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
    Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
    It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
    The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
    60:e0:d2:e8:fb:25:bf:09:53:9d:9d:59:59:45:cf:aa.
    Please contact your system administrator.
    Add correct host key in /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
    Offending key in /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts:14
    RSA host key for localhost has changed and you have requested strict checking.
    Host key verification failed.

You can do this using the following command typed into the terminal:

::

    $ ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts

This should produce output similar to:

::

    $ ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:2222 -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts 
    /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts updated.
    Original contents retained as /Users/rleigh/.ssh/known_hosts.old

The first time that you log into the |VM| you will also be asked to
confirm that you wish to connect to this machine by a message similar to
the following:

::

    $ ssh omero@localhost -p 2222
    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is 60:e0:d2:e8:fb:25:bf:09:53:9d:9d:59:59:45:cf:aa.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

You should confirm that you wish to continue connecting, after which you
will be prompted for your password as usual:

::

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    omero@localhost's password:

After which, you should have a prompt indicating
that you have a shell open and logged into the |VM|:

::

    omero@localhost's password: 
    Linux omerovm 2.6.32-5-686 #1 SMP Mon Jun 11 17:24:18 UTC 2012 i686

Log into the |VM| directly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
    Due to the frequent changes in the VirtualBox Guest
    Additions, key mappings between the host and guest |OS| do not always
    work. We recommend using |SSH| as the primary way of interacting with
    the Virtual Appliance CLI.

When you start your |VM| using the VirtualBox GUI, as outlined above, a
window will be displayed showing the boot process for the machine as it
starts up, just like with a real piece of hardware. Once the boot
process has finished you will see a prompt displayed in this window like
so:

::

    [System startup messages]

    Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 omerovm tty1

    omerovm login: _

You can log into the console of the |VM| directly using the user account
credentials above.

::

    omerovm login: omero
    Password: _

There is no GUI on the current OMERO virtual appliance so you will have
to use the Bash shell which looks like this:

::

    omero@omerovm:~$ _

From here you can interact with OMERO.server via the 
:doc:`command-line-interface`. You will need to login as the 'omero' user to 
access the OMERO CLI (user: "omero" / pw: "omero"). Logout using Ctrl-D.
