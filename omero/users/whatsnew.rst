What's new for OMERO 5.4 for users
==================================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.4 include:

- Your system administrator can now create
  :doc:`/sysadmins/admins-with-restricted-privileges` to allow facility
  managers, image analysts etc. to organize users and data in OMERO
  without having to be granted full administrator privileges. This is a way to
  cater for the needs for some trusted users to act on behalf of all the OMERO
  users in a facility, with access to all the groups and data in OMERO. Full administrators and administrator with restricted privileges can now create Project/Dataset/Screen on behalf of other users in OMERO.web.

- Improvements to OMERO.web including the display of plates and wells, the
  synchronization of controls enabling copy/paste of rendering settings, the display of 32-bit and float images, the layout of the left-hand panel and the
  ability to export images in plate as OME-TIFF.

- The 'Reverse Intensity' command in the image viewers has been renamed to
  'Invert'.

- Updated Bio-Formats bringing improved file format support.

See the :help:`User help website <>` for information on how to incorporate
these new features into your current workflows.
