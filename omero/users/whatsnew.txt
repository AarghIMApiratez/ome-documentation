What's new for OMERO 5
======================

From a user's perspective, OMERO 5 mostly alters the way import looks in
OMERO.insight. Your files are now uploaded on to the OMERO.server in their
original format which means you can always export them in this format. We have
also introduced checksums to confirm if your file has been correctly uploaded
so that you can have confidence that no corruption has occurred on import and
your files are safely stored. In combination, these changes mean that you no
longer need to store duplicates of your data outside of OMERO, for example if
you require the original format for some of your data analysis.

- :help:`Importing data guide <importing-data-5.html>` has been updated to
  illustrate the new workflow.

- :doc:`command-line-import` has also been updated to reflect the new 
  functionality.

- There is a new :help:`Getting Started guide <getting-started-5.html>`
  for OMERO 5.0.

- :doc:`command-line-interface` has been updated to document a new plugin
  which allows you to list, create, and import tags and tag sets from the
  command line.

.. note:: :doc:`demo-server` **is now available for OMERO 5.**
