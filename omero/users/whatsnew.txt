What's new for OMERO 5.2 for users
==================================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.2 include:

-  improved support for screen data formats (amongst others) and import times
   for images with many ROIs
-  reworked display of metadata and annotations in the righthand pane of both
   clients
-  improved support for attaching analytical results
-  significant improvement in client performance including for loading data
   and drag and drop actions

Note that you can no longer launch the desktop clients via Java Web Start as
we have dropped support for this due to technical issues beyond our control.
