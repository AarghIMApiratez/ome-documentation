What's new for OMERO 5
======================

From a user's perspective, OMERO 5 mostly alters the way import looks in
OMERO.insight:

- :help:`Importing data guide <importing-data-5.html>` has been updated to
  illustrate the new workflow.

- There is also a new :help:`Getting Started guide <getting-started-5.html>`
  for OMERO 5.0.

Workflow-based user guides have now moved to our new
:help:`User Help website <>`.

:doc:`command-line-interface` has been updated to document the new plugin
which allows you to list, create, and import tags and tag sets from the
command line.

.. note:: :doc:`demo-server` **is now available for OMERO 5.**
