What's new for OMERO 5.3 for users
==================================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.3 include:

- ROI Folders which allow you to organize your ROIs into a hierarchical tree
  structure of folders so they can be sorted e.g. by phenotypes or ontologies
- support for lookup tables (LUT) and reverse intensity rendering
- annotations can now be added to Wells in the clients and the UI for viewing
  Screen Plate Well data has been redesigned
- images can now be projected along T
- the new 'Open With...' functionality allows images to be opened with
  OMERO.figure or other plugins directly from OMERO.web (coming soon is a new
  web-based full image viewer - OMERO.iviewer.)

See the :help:`User help website <>` for information on how to incorporate
these new features into your current workflows.
