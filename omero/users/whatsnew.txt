What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.1 include:

- support for units throughout the Data Model allowing for example, pixel
  sizes for electron microscopy to be stored in nanometers rather than being
  set as micrometers
- new, searchable key-value pair annotations for adding experimental metadata
- improved performance for moving and deleting data
- improved performance for many file formats, including much faster import for
  HCS data and new supported formats via Bio-Formats (now over 140)
- improvements in rendering settings workflow to make it more transparent and
  also to align the functionality between OMERO.insight and OMERO.web
- improved functionality of the OMERO ImageJ plugin allowing you to import
  images to OMERO from ImageJ (both modified e.g. cropped and unmodified) and
  also save ROIs and overlays from ImageJ into OMERO without having to
  re-import if your image is already stored in OMERO
