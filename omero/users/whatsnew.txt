What's new for OMERO 5.3 for users
==================================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.3 include:

- ROI Folders in OMERO.insight which allow you to organize your ROIs into a
  hierarchical tree structure of folders so they can be sorted e.g. by
  phenotypes or ontologies (support for these is still upcoming for OMERO.web)
- support for lookup tables (LUT) and reverse/inverted intensity rendering
- annotations can now be added to Wells in the clients and a new script
  allows you to migrate existing annotations made on Images to Wells
- the UI for viewing Screen Plate Well data has been redesigned
- the new 'Open With...' functionality allows images to be opened with
  OMERO.figure or other plugins directly from OMERO.web (coming soon is a new
  web-based full image viewer - OMERO.iviewer.)
- updated Bio-Formats version to the 5.3 line, bringing improved file format
  support including support for JPEG-XR compressed CZI data

See the :help:`User help website <>` for information on how to incorporate
these new features into your current workflows.
