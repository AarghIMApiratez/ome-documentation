What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

Updates and new features for OMERO 5.1 include:

- support for units throughout the Data Model allowing for example, image
  sizes for electron microscopy to be stored in nanometers rather than all
  image sizes being set as micrometers
- new more flexible user-added metadata - key-value pair annotations
- improved performance for moving and deleting data
- improved performance for many file formats, including much faster import for
  HCS data and new supported formats via Bio-Formats (now over 140)
- the ability to copy and paste rendering settings and select between
  different users' settings in the UI
- improved functionality of the OMERO ImageJ plugin allowing you to import
  images to OMERO from ImageJ (both modified e.g. cropped and unmodified) and
  also save ROIs and overlays from ImageJ into OMERO without having to
  re-import if your image is already stored in OMERO
