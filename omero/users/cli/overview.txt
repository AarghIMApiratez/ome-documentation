Command line interface overview

.. _cli_help:

Command line help
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The |CLI| is divided into several commands which may themselves contain
subcommands. You can investigate the various commands available using the
:option:`-h` or :option:`--help` option::

    $ bin/omero -h

Again, you can use :option:`-h` repeatedly to get more details on each of
these sub-commands::

    $ bin/omero admin -h
    $ bin/omero admin start -h

The :omerocmd:`help` command can be used to get info on other commands or
options::

    $ bin/omero help debug       # debug is an option
    $ bin/omero help admin       # same as bin/omero admin -h

Command line workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways to use the command line tools:

#.  By explicitly logging in to the server first i.e. by creating a session
    using the :omerocmd:`login` command.
    The connection parameters can be either passed directly in the connection
    string::

        $ bin/omero login username@servername:4064

    or using the :option:`-s`, :option:`-u` and :option:`-p` options::

        $ bin/omero login -s servername -u username -p 4064

    If no argument can be specified, the interface will ask for the
    connection credentials::

        $ bin/omero login
        Previously logged in to localhost:4064 as root
        Server: [localhost]
        Username: [root]
        Password:

    During login, a session is created locally on disk and will remain active
    until you logout or it times out. You can then call the desired command,
    e.g. the :omerocmd:`import` command::

        $ bin/omero import image.tiff

#.  By passing the session arguments directly to the desired command, e.g.::

        $ bin/omero -s servername -u username -p 4064 import image.tiff

#.  By calling the desired command without login arguments. You will be asked
    to login::

        $ bin/omero import image.tiff
        Server: [servername]
        Username: [username]
        Password:

Once you are done with your work, you can terminate the current session if you
wish using the :omerocmd:`logout` command::

    $ bin/omero logout
