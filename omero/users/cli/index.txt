Command Line Interface as an OMERO client
=========================================

The |CLI| is a set of Python_ based system-administration, deployment and
advanced user tools. Most of commands work remotely so that the |CLI| can be
used as a client against an OMERO server.

.. note:: The end of Windows support for OMERO.server means that the CLI is
    currently unsupported on this platform too. However, we intend to make
    OMERO.python installable via pip for future releases which would restore
    Windows support for the CLI.
