Giving objects to other users
-----------------------------

The :program:`chown` command transfers objects to the ownership of a
different user. Further help is available using the :option:`-h`
option::

    $ bin/omero chown -h

The :program:`chown` command can give entire graphs of objects based on
the IDs of the topmost objects. The command can be modified to include
the transfer of objects that would, by default, be excluded or exclude
objects that would, by default, be included using the :option:`chown
--include` and :option:`chown --exclude` options.

It is also possible to give objects lower in the hierarchy by specifying
the type and ID of a topmost object and the type of the lower object.
For instance, giving all of the images under a given project.

All the data of a given user can be transferred using the
:program:`chown` command. This is useful when somebody leaves a lab to
move on to another project or institution and their previous work is to
be curated or continued by a colleague.

By default the command confirms the transfer of the target objects but
it can also provide a detailed report of all the given objects via a
:option:`chown --report` option. A :option:`chown --dry-run` option can
be used to report on what objects would be given without actually giving
them.
