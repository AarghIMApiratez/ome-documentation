Using import targets
====================

The CLI import options ``-d`` or ``-r`` can be used to specify, respectively,
the import target Dataset or Screen by ID. The option ``-T, --target`` adds
more ways of specifying the import target.

The general form of the target argument is::

    <action or Class>[:<discriminator>]:<pattern>

where the discriminator is optional. Thus a target must contain one or two
colons. Any further colons will be read as part of the pattern. If the
discriminator is omitted a default will be used depending on the action or
Class. Currently the following actions and classes are supported: Dataset,
Screen and regex.

Importing to a Dataset or Screen
--------------------------------

For Dataset and Screen the currently supported discriminators are ``name``
and ``id``. If the discriminator is omitted the default used is ``id``. So::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:id:2
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:2
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -d 2

will all have the same effect of importing the image to the Dataset with ID 2.

The ``name`` discriminator can be used to select the target by name, and so::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:name:Sample01

will import the image to the Dataset with name Sample01. If more than one
Dataset exists with the specified name the most recently created will be used.
If no Dataset exists with the specified name a new Dataset will be created
for the import.

The choice of Dataset can be specified by adding a qualifying character to the
discriminator: ``+`` to use the most recent, ``-`` to use the oldest, ``%`` to
only import if there is a unique target or ``@`` to create a new container
even if one with the correct name already exists.

For example::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:+name:Samples
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:-name:Samples
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:%name:Samples
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:@name:Samples

The first case is equivalent to the previous example, the most recent Dataset
will be used. In the second case the oldest Dataset will be used. In the third
case the import should fail if multiple datasets with that name exist. In the
first three cases a new Dataset will be created is none exists. In the last
case a new Dataset should be created even if one or more already exist.

If the name contains spaces or other characters that cannot be used on the
command line the pattern should be enclosed in quotes::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T Dataset:name:"New Dataset"

To import a plate to a Screen target the same syntax can be used as in all the
examples above, for example::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/bd-pathway/2015-12-01_000/ -T Screen:+name:Pathway

Importing using regular expressions
-----------------------------------

The local path of the file to be imported can be used to specify the target
Dataset or Screen using a regular expression using the action ``regex``. For
this action the only discriminator is ``name`` and if the discriminator is
omitted the qualified form of this ``+name`` will be used. The variable
``<Container1>`` is used to specify the Dataset or Screen in the regular
expression. For example::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T "regex:^.*images/(?<Container1>.*?)"

would use a Dataset with name being the path following ``images/``,
ie just ``dv``.

The name discriminator can be explicitly used and, as in the previous section,
also qualified::

    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T "regex:+name:^.*images/(?<Container1>.*?)"
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T "regex:-name:^.*images/(?<Container1>.*?)"
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T "regex:%name:^.*images/(?<Container1>.*?)"
    $ bin/omero import ~/images/dv/SMN10ul03_R3D_D3D.dv -T "regex:@name:^.*images/(?<Container1>.*?)"

These work as in the previous Dataset examples.
