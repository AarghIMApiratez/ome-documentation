Import images
-------------

The |CLI| import command allows you to import images to an OMERO.server from
the command line, and is ideally suited for anyone wanting to use a
shell-scripted or web-based front-end interface for importing. Based upon the
same set of libraries as the standard importer, the command line version
supports the same files formats and functions in much the same way. Visit
:bf_doc:`Supported Formats <supported-formats.html>` for a detailed list of
supported formats.

Import command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. program:: omero import

:omerocmd:`import` is probably the first command many users will want to use.
To import a file image.tiff, use::

    $ bin/omero import image.tiff

Some of the options available to the import command are:

.. option:: -h, --help

    Display the help for the import command

.. option:: -f

    Display all the used files for importing then exits::

        $ bin/omero import -f image.tif
        $ bin/omero import -f images_folder

.. option:: --depth DEPTH

    Set the number of directories to scan down for files (default: 4)::

        $ bin/omero import --depth 1 images_folder

.. option:: --skip SKIP

    Specify optional step to skip during import.

    The import of very large datasets like High-Content Screening data or
    SPIM data can be time and resource consuming both at the client and at the
    server level. This option allows the disabling of some non-critical steps
    and thus faster import of such datasets. The caveat associated with its
    usage is that some elements are no longer generated at import time and may
    either be re-generated during client access (e.g. thumbnails) or may need
    manual intervention to be generated (e.g. minmax).
    Available options that can be skipped are currently:

    all
        Skip all optional steps described below
    checksum
        Skip checksum calculation either on files after transfer or on pixels
    minmax
        Skip computation of the minima and maxima pixel values
    thumbnails
        Skip generation of thumbnails
    upgrade
        Skip upgrade check for Bio-Formats

    Example of usage::

        $ bin/omero import large_image --skip all
        $ bin/omero import large_image --skip minmax

    Multiple import steps can be skipped by supplying multiple arguments::

        $ bin/omero import large_image --skip checksum --skip minmax

.. option:: --debug DEBUG

    Set the debug level for the command line import output::

        $ bin/omero import images_folder --debug WARN

Other advanced import options are described in the :ref:`inplace_import`
section.

Java Command Line Importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways to use the importer from the command line:

* ``importer-cli`` shell script, included for Linux and Macintosh only
* ``ome.formats.importer.cli.CommandLineImporter`` Java class
* ``bin/omero import`` command, from a server installation only

Using the importer using the shell script might look like this:

::

    ./importer-cli -s localhost -u user -w pass path/to/file

To use the ``ome.formats.importer.cli.CommandLineImporter`` class from java on
the command line you will also need to include a classpath to the required
support jars. Please look inside of the ``importer-cli`` script for an example
of how to do this.

With a server installation, from server directory, execute the following
command:

::

    bin/omero -s localhost -u user import path/to/file

Note that this method will prompt for any mandatory arguments not provided.

The importer can also be used to detect what files *would* be imported:

::

    ./importer-cli -f /path/to/file

or

::

    bin/omero import -f /path/to/file

will output a list of all the files which would be imported in groups
separated by "#" comments. Note that this usage does not require a running
server to be available.

Command Line options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Command Line Importer tool takes a number of mandatory and optional
arguments to run, as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /downloads/cli/help.out

These options will also be displayed on the command line by passing no
arguments to the importer.

.. note::
    - Using the ``--report`` option sends an automated error report to the QA application.
      HTTP POST requests are currently used to upload the report. The default parameters (eg. endpoint URL)
      may be overridden via an INI-formatted configuration file, which is expected to be located within
      a ``config`` directory relative to the CLI importer (see example below).

    - The ``--email`` option is the OMERO user's contact email. Note that errors are *not* sent to this address.

Sample :file:`config/importer.config` INI file:

.. literalinclude:: /downloads/cli/import.config

.. seealso:: :doc:`/sysadmins/import-scenarios`
