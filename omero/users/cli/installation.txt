Installation
------------

Check you have Python_ installed by typing::

    $ python --version
    Python 2.7.5+

Additionally, Ice_ must be installed on your machine::

    $ python -c "import Ice"

The |CLI| is currently bundled with the OMERO.server. Download the version
corresponding to your system from the :downloads:`OMERO downloads <>` page.

.. note::
	The |CLI| is bundled with the OMERO.server but that does not imply you
	must use that directory as a server. You can download the server zip to a
	number of machines and use the |CLI| commands from each machine to access
	an existing OMERO instance.

Once the server is downloaded, the |CLI| is located under the :file:`bin/`
directory::

    $ cd OMERO.server
    $ bin/omero -h
    OMERO Python Shell. Version 4.4.5-ice33
    Type "help" for more information, "quit" or Ctrl-D to exit
