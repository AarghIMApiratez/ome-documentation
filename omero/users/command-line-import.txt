The Command Line Import
=======================

The Command Line Importer tool (CLI) allows you to import images to an
OMERO.server from the command line, and is ideally suited for anyone
wanting to use a shell-scripted or web-based front-end interface for
importing. Based upon the same set of libraries as the standard
importer, the command line version supports the same files formats and
functions in much the same way. Visit :bf_doc:`Supported Formats <supported-formats.html>` 
for a detailed list of supported formats.

Starting the Command Line Importer
----------------------------------

There are two ways to use the importer: 
 * Either by using the included shell scripts for Linux and Macintosh, 
 * or by calling directly the ``ome.formats.importer.cli.CommandLineImporter`` class from java on the command line (you will also need to include a path to the required support jars - look inside of the importer-cli scripts for an example of how to do this.)

An example of starting the importer from the command line might look
like this:

::

    ./importer-cli …

From server installation
------------------------

::

    #!sh
    bin/omero -s localhost -u user import …

This can also be used to detect what a command ''would'' import.

::

    #!sh
    bin/omero import -f /path/to/file

will print on standard out a list of all the files which would be
imported in groups separated by "#" comments.

Command Line options
--------------------

The Command Line Importer tool takes a number of mandatory and optional
arguments to run, as follows:

.. literalinclude:: /downloads/cli/help.out

These options will also be displayed on the command line by passing no
arguments to the importer.

.. note::
    - Using the ``--report`` option sends an automated error report to the QA application.
      HTTP POST requests are currently used to upload the report. The default parameters (eg. endpoint URL)
      may be overridden via an INI-formatted configuration file, which is expected to be located within
      a ``config`` directory relative to the CLI importer (see example below).

    - The ``--email`` option is the OMERO user's contact email. Note that errors are *not* sent to this address.

Sample :file:`config/importer.config` INI file:

.. literalinclude:: /downloads/cli/import.config
