OMERO virtual appliance
=======================

.. note:: The virtual appliance is being discontinued. Previous versions will
    remain available for download but :downloads_va:`OMERO 5.2.1 <>` will be
    the most recent release.

The OMERO virtual appliance is a quick, easy, and low-cost way to try
out OMERO.server on your laptop or desktop. This enables you to make
an informed decision about whether committing to an OMERO.server
install is right for you.

Virtualization enables canned, ready to run software environments to be
created and used, in the form of |VM|, or to be
distributed for others to use, in the form of virtual appliances. A
Virtual Appliance is essentially a file that describes how to create a
new Virtual Machine on demand. The virtualized software environment can
contain an entire |OS|, such as Windows or Linux, and
any other software that runs in that |OS|, such as, in this case,
OMERO.server and its associated software prerequisites. Once created and
started, you can log into the |OS| and use it as though it were a real
machine. One way to think of this is as though you had an entire
computer in a window on your desktop.

When using virtualization software, the |OS| that is running the
virtualization software is referred to as the "**host OS**". When you
use virtualization, the |OS| running within a virtual machine is referred
to as the "**guest OS**". This allows us to be explicit about which |OS|
we are working in.

This technology allows the OME Project to distribute a canned,
ready-to-run environment containing an OMERO.server, freeing you
from having to install the server and prerequisites yourself, and letting you
concentrate on evaluating the functionality of the OMERO platform.

.. note:: 
    The virtual hard-drive used by the OMERO virtual appliance is
    30GB in size and you should keep track of the amount of this
    space you have consumed and, if necessary, delete data that is not
    required. If your data is likely to exceed this space whilst you are
    evaluating OMERO then it is worthwhile going through the
    :ref:`increasing-hd-size` before you start working with
    OMERO in earnest.

Getting started
---------------

To use the virtual appliance you should do the following:

-  Install VirtualBox
-  :downloads_va:`Download the OMERO.server virtual appliance <>`
-  Import the virtual appliance into VirtualBox to create a virtual
   machine
-  Start the virtual machine

Each of these points is outlined in full detail below. Once you have
everything installed, the virtual appliance should just work straight out of
the box but if you have any problems, there is further guidance available for
:doc:`va-troubleshooting` and :doc:`va-working`.

Install VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download VirtualBox from the
`VirtualBox Downloads page <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ and 
follow the installation process for your platform. If in doubt, you should 
download, or upgrade to, the latest version of VirtualBox. Once VirtualBox is
installed, run the application. Depending upon your platform and version,
the VirtualBox interface should look similar to the following
screenshot:

Download the OMERO.server virtual appliance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The virtual appliance has its own :downloads_va:`download page <>` and will
have a filename similar to omero-va-|release|.ova.

Import OMERO virtual appliance into VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Start VirtualBox then select **'File/Import Appliance'**. You will be
   presented with a dialog box.
-  Select and navigate to the location where you downloaded the
   the virtual appliance file.
-  Select your OVA file then click **open**.

This process is indicated in the screenshot below.

-  Click **continue**. You will be presented with a range of options for
   the |VM| that will be built from the appliance.

   Virtual appliance import settings

-  You can accept the defaults by clicking **Import**.

You should now see a progress bar as your new virtual machine is built
from the appliance. This may take a few minutes depending upon your hardware.

When the import procedure is complete, your new |VM| should appear in the
VirtualBox |VM| library ready for use.

Networking
^^^^^^^^^^

Our virtual appliance is distributed with VirtualBox's built in
Host-Only Network Address Translation (NAT) preconfigured. This means
that the IP address for the |VM| is 10.0.2.15 as this is the default
VirtualBox Host-Only NAT address. Using this address is the simplest way
to distribute a virtual appliance when you do not know the setup of a
user's network.

.. _virtualappliance_portforwarding:

Port-forwarding settings
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Your host |OS| cannot connect directly to 10.0.2.15 but needs to use
port-forwarding. This means that you connect to your localhost on a
specific port and the communications to and from that port are forwarded
to specified ports on the guest |VM|.

Our virtual appliance should be preconfigured with the correct
port-forwarding setting during the import process. However,
it is best to double check that these settings are correct:

-  Select your |VM| in the VirtualBox |VM| Library
-  Click on **Settings** then select the **Network** tab
-  Click on **Advanced**
-  Click on **Port Forwarding**

If the table in the window that appears is empty then port forwarding is
not setup. The required port-forwarding settings are as follows:

=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
Name        Protocol Host IP   Host Port Guest IP  Guest Port
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========
omero-ssl   TCP      127.0.0.1 4064      10.0.2.15  4064
omero-unsec TCP      127.0.0.1 4063      10.0.2.15  4063
omero-web   TCP      127.0.0.1 8080      10.0.2.15  8080
ssh         TCP      127.0.0.1 2222      10.0.2.15  22
=========== ======== ========= ========= ========= ==========

When correctly setup in VirtualBox, your port forwarding settings should
look like this:

   VirtualBox port forwarding

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you can either use our port
forwarding setup script or you can set up port forwarding manually. 

On Microsoft Windows systems you will have to set up port forwarding manually
as the script requires a Bash shell.

.. only:: html

    The script is in the file :download:`setup_port_forwarding.sh </downloads/setup_port_forwarding.sh>` (click to view or download).

.. only:: latex

    The script can be downloaded from the online version of this  
    documentation; see `<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero/users/virtual-appliance.html>`_.

After obtaining the script, it can be used in the following manner:
::

    $ bash setup_port_forwarding.sh $VMNAME

where $VMNAME is the name of your |VM|. 

.. note:: 
    By default the scripts create a |VM| named **omerovm** and the
    pre-built appliance is named **omero-vm**

Adding port forwarding manually is achieved by editing the port
forwarding table shown above. Use the ``+`` to add a new
row to the table, then click in each cell and type in the required
settings.

Now you are ready to start your |VM|. Select the |VM| in the VirtualBox |VM|
library then click **start**.

A window should open containing a console for your |VM| which should now
be going through its standard boot process. OMERO.server is
automatically started at boot time, meaning that you should be able to
interact with OMERO without further setup.

Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^

The following accounts are preconfigured in the OMERO virtual appliance: an
|OS| account, for logging into the |VM| as the **omero** user, and a single
OMERO.server account which is used to access the OMERO.server software as the
OMERO.server **root** user.

Virtual Appliance |OS| credentials
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

======== =========
Username Password
======== =========
omero      omero
======== =========

A 'root' |OS| account is not needed as the omero account is able to run
administrative commands via sudo with no password required.

OMERO.server credentials
""""""""""""""""""""""""

======== ========
Username Password
======== ========
root     omero
======== ========

You can use this administrative account to create as many user level accounts
as you require in the usual way.

Using the virtual appliance
---------------------------

Further guidance on how to interact with the server and troubleshoot common
issues is available. See :doc:`va-working` and :doc:`va-troubleshooting`. In
particular, :ref:`increasing the base memory allocation <memory-allocation>`
may significantly improve import performance.
