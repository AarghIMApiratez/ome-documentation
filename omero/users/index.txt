About the OMERO Platform

************
Introduction
************

OME Remote Objects (OMERO) is a modern client-server software platform
for visualizing, managing, and annotating scientific image data. OMERO
lets you import and archive your images, annotate and tag them, record
your experimental protocols, and export images in a number of formats. It also
allows you to collaborate with colleagues anywhere in the world by creating
user groups with different permission levels. OMERO consists of a Java server,
several Java client applications, as well as Python and C++ bindings
and a Django-based web application.

The OMERO clients are cross-platform. To run on your computer they require
Java |javaversion| or higher to be installed. This can easily be installed
from http://java.com/en if it is not already included in your OS. The
OMERO.insight client gets all of its information from a remote OMERO.server â€”
the location of which is specified at login. Since this connection utilises a
standard network connection, the client can be run anytime the user is
connected to the internet.

This documentation is for the OMERO 5 Platform. This version is designed
to improve our handling of complex multidimensional datasets. It allows you to
upload your files in their original format, preserving file names and any
nested directory structure in the server repository. For more technical
information, please refer to the :doc:`/developers/index`. You can read about
the development of OMERO in the :doc:`history`.

Additional resources
********************

-   :omero_plone:`About OMERO <>` introduces OMERO for new users, while
    the :omero_plone:`Features List <feature-list>` provides an overview
    of the platform features with those that are new for OMERO 5.2
    highlighted.

-   Workflow-based user assistance guides are provided on our
    :help:`help website <>`.

-   As OMERO is an open source project with developers and users in many
    countries, :doc:`connecting to the community <community-resources>` can
    provide you with a wealth of experience to draw on for help and advice.

-   Our partners within the OME consortium are working on
    integrating additional functions and modules with OMERO. See the
    :partner_plone:`Partner Projects <>` page for details of the latest
    extensions which could help OMERO meet your research needs more fully.

-   You can also extend the functionality of OMERO using
    OMERO.scripts, our version of plugins. Guides to some of the scripts which
    ship with OMERO releases are already provided, but you can also check out
    our :community_plone:`Script Sharing <scripts>` page to find extra ones.

Quickstart server access
************************

If your institution does not have an existing OMERO.server for you to connect
to, you can apply for an account on our demo server. Alternatively, you can
create your own using a virtual appliance (a step-by-step guide for how to do
this is provided).

.. note:: The virtual appliance is being discontinued. Previous versions will
    remain available for download but OMERO 5.2.1 will be the most recent
    release.
